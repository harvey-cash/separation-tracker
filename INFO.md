# What Is Brave Paws For?

## Canine Separation Anxiety

Separation anxiety is one of the most common behavioural problems in pet dogs. A dog with separation anxiety becomes distressed whenever it is left alone — barking, pacing, destructing furniture, or attempting to escape. The condition is not a training-obedience issue; it is an involuntary panic response that the dog cannot simply "learn to stop."

## The Gold-Standard Treatment: Gradual Desensitisation

The most effective, welfare-friendly treatment is **gradual desensitisation** — a structured programme of planned absences that are:

- **Below the anxiety threshold.** Every departure is short enough that the dog does not become distressed. If the dog is currently only comfortable alone for 10 seconds, training starts at 10 seconds — not 10 minutes.
- **Cue-less.** The owner removes predictable departure cues (picking up keys, putting on shoes, saying goodbye) so the dog cannot anticipate the absence and begin to panic before it even begins.
- **Randomised in duration.** Steps within a session vary up and down rather than increasing in a straight line. This prevents the dog from learning that each absence is always longer than the last, which itself can trigger anxiety.
- **Gradually extended over many sessions.** The maximum absence time creeps upward across days and weeks, but only when previous sessions show the dog remained calm.

Each training session is a set of short departures performed back-to-back. After every session the owner assesses how the dog coped and decides whether to push slightly further next time or hold steady.

## How Brave Paws Helps

Brave Paws is a tracker built around this protocol. It lets you:

1. **Plan** a session — create a list of timed steps (e.g. 30 s → 10 s → 1 min → 15 s → 2 min).
2. **Run** the session — a per-step countdown timer guides each departure while a stopwatch tracks total training time.
3. **Rate** the session — record whether your dog was Calm, Coping, or Panicking, and add notes.
4. **Review** your history — browse past sessions, chart your dog's maximum independence time over weeks, and export data to CSV.

All data stays on your device in the browser — no account, no server, no cloud.

## Key Principles to Remember

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| Stay below threshold | A single over-threshold absence can set progress back days. |
| Remove departure cues | Predictability fuels anticipation anxiety. |
| Vary step durations | Monotonically increasing times teach the dog "it only gets worse." |
| Train frequently | Short daily sessions beat long infrequent ones. |
| Trust the data | Progress can feel invisible day-to-day — the chart shows the real trend. |
