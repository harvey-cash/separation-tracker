# Brave Paws Workspace

This repository contains two first-class applications:

1. `Brave Paws App` in `apps/brave-paws-app`, the React web app for planning, running, and reviewing separation-anxiety training sessions.
2. `Brave Paws Streamer` in `apps/brave-paws-streamer`, the Windows camera-streaming companion used to pair a live dog-camera feed with the app.

The repo is organized as an npm workspaces monorepo. Each app keeps its own source, tests, build config, and package manifest inside its project directory. The root package only orchestrates shared install, CI, release, and convenience commands.
